The XBee related Android Open Accessory Demo consists of 

- One AOA Board that acts as a gateway and configures
  an XBee module to be a Coordinator.

- One or more "Xbee nodes".

- An Android device with the Demo_AOA_Nodes App installed.
  The device connects to the gateway and controls the nodes.

This sample application is an implementation of an "XBee
node" that runs on an LPC1769 LPCXpresso Board (EA-XPR-003)
together with an LPCXpresso Base Board (EA-XPR-021).

This sample application has been tested with an XBee
module Series 1.
